# Single-Page-HTML-CV
https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
IMPORTANT NOTE: This is my very first project to ever make, so expect some mistakes here and there.
The goal after finishing this is receiving criticism and crucial feedback on how to improve myself using HTML on future projects. Any help is greatly appreciated.
This is also my first time using Github and submitting my code on this site, so the only thing I can think of when trying to run my code is simply copy/paste unless there's some other way I don't know about.
